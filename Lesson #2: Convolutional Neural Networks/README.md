# Lesson #2: Convolutional Neural Networks
## We'll be using a Convolutional Neural Network to try and predict the specific type of fashion accessory included in the image!
### The master edition of the notebook has all the code filled in, and you can try tinkering with the parameters and other variables to optimize the neural network. See how well you stack up by submitting to [Kaggle Competition #2](https://www.kaggle.com/c/first-2)! (The submission generation script is also part of the notebook)
